        <h3>Dawson Sullivan</h3>
        <h4>Student - Management Information Systems</h4>
        <p>My name is Dawson Sullivan, and I am a senior at the University of Oklahome studying Management Information Systems.
        I am originally from the small town of Idabel, OK, so going places and experiencing new things is something I am always looking for.
        The University of Oklahoma has prepared me for post-graduate life in a multitude of ways, but, most importantly, it has provided me with an extensive background in Management Information Systems and its related fields.
        Through course work involving the building and implementation of databases, I have become comfortable working with a variety of softwares and coding languages to interact with those softwares.
        With this knowledge, I hope to find a career involving database management.</p>
