        <h3>Database Project</h3>

        <p>
            For this project, my team and I worked with a non-profit organization that needed a better system for organizing information about multiple of their business processes.
            My team and I took sample data and created a database for their future use. I also implemendted SQL statements into this database that they can use to analyze the data in order to answer some of their most important questions.
